# In development for Microsoft Intune - August 2019

To assist in your readiness and planning, this page lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we’ll publish a complementary Office Message Center post.
- When a feature is launched in production, either as a preview or generally available, the feature description will move off this page and onto the [What's New page](whats-new.md).
- This page and the [What's New page](whats-new.md) are updated periodically. Check back for additional updates.
- Refer to the [M365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

> [!Note]
> These items reflect Microsoft’s current expectations about Intune capabilities coming in a future release. Dates and individual features may change. Not all items in development have a feature description on this page.

## App management

### Control iOS app uninstall behavior at device unenrollment <!-- 3504144 -->
Admins will be able to manage whether an app is removed or retained on a device when the device is unenrolled at a user or device group level. 

### Categorize Microsoft Store for Business apps <!-- 3926922 -->
You'll be able to categorize Microsoft Store for Business apps. To do so, choose **Intune** > **Client apps** > **Apps** > Select a Microsoft Store for Business app > **App Information** > **Category**. On the drop-down menu, assign a category.
### Configure app notification content for organization accounts <!-- 2576686 -->
Intune app protection policies (APP) on Android and iOS devices will allow you to control app notification content for Org accounts. This feature will require support from applications and may not be available for all APP enabled applications. For more about APP, see [What are app protection policies?](app-protection-policy.md).

### Available Google Play app reporting for Android work profiles <!-- 3041956  -->
For available app installs on Android work profile devices, you can view app installation status and the installed version of managed Google Play apps. For more information, see [How to monitor app protection policies](app-protection-policies-monitor.md), [Manage Android work profile devices with Intune](android-enterprise-overview.md) and [Managed Google Play app type](apps-add-android-for-work.md#managed-google-play-app-type).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device configuration

### Some unsupervised iOS device restrictions will become supervised-only with the iOS 13.0 release <!-- 4867809  -->
Some settings will apply to supervised devices with the iOS 13.0 release. These settings include:

- App Store, Doc Viewing, Gaming
  - App store

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Role-based access control

### Default scope tag <!-- 3702875 -->
A new built-in default scope tag will be available. All untagged Intune objects that support scope tags will be automatically assigned to the default scope tag. The **Default** scope tag will be added to all existing role assignments to maintain parity with the admin experience today. If you don't want an admin to see Intune objects with default scope tags, remove the default scope tag from the role assignment. This feature is similar to the security scopes feature in System Center Configuration Manager.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Security

### Import and export security baselines    <!--3408610          -->
